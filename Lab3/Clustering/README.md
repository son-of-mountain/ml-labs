**Definition of Unsupervised Learning :**
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a dataset with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human-labeled data, unsupervised learning, also known as self-organization allows for modeling of probability densities over inputs.

**Definition of Clustering Definition:**
Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields. It is the task of dividing the population or data points into several groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.

**Different Clustering Algorithms Definition:**

1. **K-Means Clustering**: K-Means clustering is an iterative algorithm that divides a group of n datasets into k subgroups /clusters based on the mean distance from the centroid.

2. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: It is a density-based clustering algorithm, which can find out the clusters of different shapes and sizes from a large amount of data, which is containing noise and outliers.

3. **Agglomerate Hierarchical Clustering**: Agglomerate hierarchical clustering is a bottom-up clustering method where clusters have sub-clusters, which in turn have sub-clusters, etc. The classic example of this is species taxonomy. Gene expression data might also exhibit this hierarchical quality (e.g. organ > tissue > cell type > cell).

4. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. One can think of mixture models as generalizing k-means clustering to incorporate information about the covariance structure of the data as well as the centers of the latent Gaussians.

5. **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**: SOM is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction.
